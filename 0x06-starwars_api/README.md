# Star Wars API

This project is focused on interview coding challenges related to the Star Wars universe.

## Tasks To Complete

### Task 0: Star Wars Characters

The script `0-starwars_characters.js` is designed to accomplish the following:

- **Movie Selection:** The script allows you to select a Star Wars movie by providing its Movie ID. For example, Movie ID 3 corresponds to "Return of the Jedi."

- **Character List:** It retrieves and displays the list of characters from the selected Star Wars movie. The order of character names matches the sequence in the `/films/` endpoint.

- **Data Source:** To accomplish this task, the script leverages the Star Wars API.

- **Request Module:** The script employs the "request" module to make HTTP requests to the Star Wars API for data retrieval.

This coding challenge is an exploration of working with the Star Wars API and showcasing characters from the selected movie.
